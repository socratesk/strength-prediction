					A concrete block is made of mixing of various ingredients with a specific  composition and allowed to cure for a certain number of days. Once it is cured, the <a href="https://civildigital.com/compressive-strength-concrete-concrete-cubes/" target="_blank">compressive strength</a>, a vital characteristic of a concrete block, is determined by subjecting it into destructive testing, using Universal Testing Machine (UTM). The destructive testing is required as the compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.<br> <br>
					
					The  strength of a concrete block varies with the type of ingredients, its composition, and the number of days it is allowed to cure. Since there are many ingredients involved, and each component has a broad spectrum, it is a tedious process, in terms of time, effort, and cost to compute the strength for each parameter.

					To address the challenge, a Machine Learning Model is developed to compute the strength for various values of the ingredients and the number of days it is allowed to cure.<br> <br>
